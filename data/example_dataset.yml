  summary: Science Teacher to Junior Developer at Shift
  testimonial: "I landed the job 28 days after finishing the course."
  cohort_month: Remote April
  cohort_year: 2016
  categories:
    - remote
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as Assistant Head of Science (Science Teacher).
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I liked the fact that there was loads to learn so you could never really get bored. Careers are long so I wanted something engaging and that could keep me challenged for a life time.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I read a blog post by a lady in America that went from waitress to developer in 3 months and it sounded awesome so I started googling European bootcamps and found Makers.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Learning frameworks, especially AngularJS in such a short amount of time is tough. Really you need to build several applications before you feel that you've 'learnt' that framework.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I applied for 18 jobs via job boards and managed to get an interview and landed the job 28 days after finishing the course.
    - question: Where are you now working?
      answer: The company is called Shift which is building the e-commerce platform for Matalan Direct.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: The biggest change is that now I realise nothing is impossible to learn, it just requires time and patience. Before I started I was terrible with computers, I got really frustrated when something didn't work. Now I see it as an opportunity to solve a problem.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you have half a mind to change just do it. Otherwise you'll always wonder, you can always go back to what you were doing later.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £4000 is expensive?
      answer: As part of the earlier Remote course I paid £2500 which was the price before. But I had a mortgage and other bills during the course so the total investment in changing careers has been nearly £10k, which seems like a lot but I still owe £23k in student loans, so compared to that it's much cheaper.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Before joining Makers I wasn't really worried, I researched the developer jobs in my area and believed I'd manage to fine a job. I knew if I dedicated myself 100% I'd be able to learn in a short amount of time. I asked question and did my research, I'd advise anyone thinking about joining to do the same so that they can go into the experience without worrying.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Frustrating and daunting but amazing and I wouldn't change any of it.

  summary: Physics graduate to Junior Developer at Simply Business
  testimonial: "Makers Academy was incredibly tiring and incredibly worthwhile."
  cohort_month: September
  cohort_year: 2016
  categories:
    - education-leaver
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was studying Physics at Kings University, London. I graduated 2 weeks before I started Makers Academy.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had some exposure to coding during my degree. It was in a very different way. It was very maths focussed which was boring but the work itself was fun. A friend of mine who came to Makers Academy recommended it to me. I took a big gamble on it by doing it straight after university.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: What I found the most difficult was adapting to a new way of learning. At university the learning was in a very insular manor but here I felt that I had to rely on people much more as we had to learn lots in a short amount of time.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Straight after I spent time getting my CV in order etc. I applied to lots of jobs. I didn't hear back from many. I had a couple of interviews that didn't go anywhere so I went back to my previous job as a chef and while doing that I kept applying to things and carrying on learning to code and eventually got a job at Simply Business.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you are very passionate about it, go for it.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: If it's something you are really passionate about then you need to make the sacrifice but you can see how it will benefit you in the future.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest fear was that it was going to be something that I didn't enjoy doing. Because I had committed a lot of time and money to it which I could spent doing finding a post uni job but it's all worked out well now. I was scared of wasting time and money.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Incredibly tiring and incredibly worthwhile.

  cohort_month: August
  cohort_year: 2016
  categories:
    - women
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a front end developer at a startup called Tibit.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I started doing front end as it's fun to use and easy to impress people who don't know about code. I like to build stuff.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: The lead developer at Tibit came to Makers Academy also my mum found out about Makers and was the driving force behind me coming here.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I found working with people and having to explain everything I do at every stage of development starting from why I'm naming my variable and why I use that particular if statement difficult to get used too.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I have a frontend job at Career Interactive and the opportunity to move into backend later.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Make sure that you really enjoy what you've chosen.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: It's worth it. You get to meet people and work in a different environment and learn A LOT. £8k is cheap compared to university.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I wouldn't find it useful and that I'd been bored. Sometimes I knew more than others but that levelled out towards the end of the course. There were lots of peer teaching opportunities.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It's been good. I've met a lot of different people. The cohort was very diverse. It's been quite surreal experience.

  summary: Tech Recruiter to Junior Developer at The Financial Times
  testimonial: "Makers Academy is a life investment that will free you out of a boring job"

  cohort_year: 2016
  categories:
    - women
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a tech recruiter.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: In previous jobs I had to use awful databases. I wanted to build better systems to make life easier for people.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: A company I was working for was [hiring](www.makersacademy.com/employers) from Makers. I researched all other coding bootcamps and came to a very firm decision to go with Makers.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I was constantly feeling stupid and then returned home brain fried every day.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I used all of my contacts and Makers Academy Hiring Partners to get introductions into companies without having to apply the traditional way and kept a spreadsheet to track progress. The careers team helped me get a job at The Financial Times.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: It's life changing - just go and do it. Make sure to save more than you think you need, last thing you want is to run out of money.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: It's a life investment that will free you out of a boring job. Think about the university degrees we all have, they were far more expensive, time consuming and totally worthless in the real world.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Not keeping up. I made peace with the feeling of discomfort and went steadily at my own pace.

  summary: 3D Designer to Junior Developer at Play Consulting
  testimonial:
  cohort_month: March
  cohort_year: 2015
  categories:
    - women
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I did a lot of things, I was an archeologist, a 3D designer but didn't like the company where I was working.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had the opportunity to learn coding as a kid and wanted to try it as an adult. While going through a quarter life crisis, I tried lots of things and had an Art History degree. I tried being an artist and museum work. Coding reminded me of my youth. I liked it as a kid and thought I'd enjoy it as an adult.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I love the concept of growing with a start up and liked the startup life. I could've picked General Assembly but it wasn't a startup, they're well established and around the world. Makers Academy drew me in because it was young and it seemed to be cool to grow with the school. They could teach me and I could teach them. When I started we were in the smaller, old building and saw all of the renovations going on. The company feels agile and it taught me a lot about startup life.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The most difficult part of the course was that I kept comparing myself to others. At uni you're expected to get an A and higher marks than your class. I really felt like that I was comparing myself to others too much. I had to get myself out of that mindset and into a personal growth mindset. That was the most important part.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: We did a cool project that was an [app that was integrated with Spotify](https://turnuptunein.herokuapp.com/) that allows you, as a party planner to start a party. You can send a link to a playlist to the party guests that uses geolocation via a beacon which in turn will only add your songs to the community playlist while you're at the party. Job wise I wanted to work for a startup and enjoyed the startup vibe. I joined a startup called Play Consulting. I was the 7th employee and now they are 22. There's 2 sides to the company, a client side and an IP side. I'm on the client side. We work for a consultancy company through the startup who ask us to do a lot of different projects with them.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I have a career now which is what I was looking for my whole life. Work feels like fun and I've finally found a job I love.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Development is a really cool mixture of Art and Math, creative and technical. It's an amazing convergence of these 2 worlds. You can create math algorithms or be a Front End developer and it's about extending both sides of your mind and don't settle for being technical or creative. I think it's getting close everyday to when tech and art become one. If you see how music has developed into tech and creation, it's the same with software development.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: It is a lot of money but I would say that it's worth every penny as a small investment for the rest of your life. You get so much support here with a consistent help network. Small classes and AMAZING coaches who are all professionals in the industry. They give you a lot of help job hunting. When you leave, you don't actually leave Makers.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was worried about the time commitment more than anything but it turned out that all I wanted to do was code. It was a good preparation to going into the workforce because I actually code less now than when I was studying! I wanted to utilise all of the knowledge that was spread around here.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Makers Academy not only focuses on your learning for code but they also focus on your mental health and well-being with the yoga & meditation classes. It's the only place that I know that has a Chief Joy Officer. It's an environment where you get to learn for and work with an amazing team of people everyday and you get the support in all parts of your life. One of the first things that Jordan said when I started was that we all had to do physical exercise and that was going to be heavily integrated into our experience here because it's not healthy to have a non physical lifestyle and it's great Makers pushes both parts of that.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer:  I had my own business as a street food trader in Brighton.
    - question: How did you find learning remotely?
      answer: It wasn't difficult because with all the available technologies there wasn't any inconvenience.
    - question: How has your life changed since learning to code?
      answer: I never studied anything like this before or had a job that required me to think so much so the change has been huge. Makers Academy has been a life changing experience.
    - question: Where are you now working?
      answer: News UK
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: As long as you can support your self without working for 4 to 5 months go for it. It's a short term sacrifice but you come out at the end with a job and an awesome salary that will only go up quickly.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £4000 is expensive?
      answer: As long as you are in a tech hub or willing to move to one you will get this money back within less than 2 months on your new salary. It's a no brainer!
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy Remote and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I never thought I could code, it looked too difficult for me, I thought it was for smart people only, and don't get me wrong it is not easy and I don't know everything I should know to do my job but I can continue learning whilst getting paid!
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy Remote experience?
      answer: It was like many people say intense! There was little time left to spend with my family and do other things apart from coding, so its hard to adjust but it will definitely pay off 3 months later.

  summary: Telecoms Engineering	to Junior Developer at Kwiboo

  cohort_month: Remote July
  cohort_year: 2016
  categories:
    - career-changer
    - remote
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer:  I was doing lots of things, I worked as a consultant, worked for BT and then setup a start-up about competitive intelligence which eventually liquidated. I finally decided that the world was missing a software developer so decided to learn to code.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I thoroughly researched the market, (as I worked in competitive intelligence it helped to research all different competitors). I wanted to focus to the .NET but no courses/bootcamps provided that. I finally decided to do Makers because the concepts are the same and I thought I could transition later on after doing the course.
    - question: How did you find learning remotely?
      answer: Great! The cohort was very supportive, and I personally was having lots of fun. Also there was a routine and lots of pair programming so that helped to keep up motivation.
    - question: What was your final project?
      answer: We did "Phlash!" A curated copy of snapchat, take a picture, and get it automatically shared with your list of "Phollowers". Bad pose? Double chin on show? No worries, the picture is automatically erased in two seconds. 11 days of intense group work where we used Agile methodology. We built it in Swift, a new language to me!
    - question: How has your life changed since learning to code?
      answer: Before I was ugly, overweight, and depressed. Now that I "know" how to code, I am tall, handsome and exude happiness all around! Oh well, perhaps not so much, but the fact that I can go to work everyday and fix a number of problems is simply fantastic! And the learning never ends, I simply love it! I even managed to lose weight during the course, I swear!
    - question: Where are you now working?
      answer: I work for Kwiboo, a small development house that is literally 5 mins from my home. The team is fantastic and very helpful, and I have started developing web sites with ASP.NET and using MVC that we learnt on the course. They are a Microsoft Gold Partner and have the bleeding edge tools. I am very happy being there!
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: To act, asap! Of course coding is not for everyone, but you can easily check if you are the coder type, and [book some pair programming](https://makersacademy.sharetribe.com/) sessions with former graduates or gatekeepers and see if you feel the excitement. If so, don't think a single second. GO FOR IT!
    - question: What do you say to people who say £4000 is expensive?
      answer: Think about it in these terms; if you want to be a graduate in London, you need to spend 3 years in University studying hard and you'll end up spending around GBP35K-40k - don't take my word for it, check [this link](http://university.which.co.uk/advice/student-finance/how-much-debt-will-i-actually-get-into-by-going-to-university) and then if you are lucky you will get a job of around £20k to start with and get out of debt slowly. Now think about the Makers Academy route, £4k and 4 months of intense work. Yes 4 months, because the first month of the PreCourse is very important and even if they say it is part time you should put as much effort as possible. The good thing is that on those 4 months you don't have a lot of time to spend money so running costs can be very low. You have a great time with your cohort studying and absorbing the concepts. Finally, if you apply to London or other main UK cities you should get around £30k for your first Junior Developer role. You'll get out of debt in a few months. So which option do you prefer? Even for other countries I know they are opportunities particularly in main cities to get coding jobs, so the cost:reward ratio is extremely attractive
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy Remote and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was not particularly afraid of the technical aspect, as I was already familiar with technology, (although not with coding in particular). But I have seen people who had not written a single line of code in their lives to do extremely on the course. My main fear was if was able to find a job after the course, particularly in my area in Suffolk where there are not a lot of coding companies around. But the market is hot and coding is one of those industries where growth is predicted for decades to come. Again I researched the companies which use software developers, (.NET and JavaScript) in my town and I found 3. I applied to 2 of them, and one of them hired me even though they were not even looking for junior developers. So my fears were completely removed. They are jobs to be found for passionate people that make the effort, and that can be done in just a few months!
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy Remote experiences
      answer: Fantastic experience overall, I have really enjoyed it, I was even sad that it finished. Makers Academy really does what it says on the tin, "Makers Academy is Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp. With our help, you'll learn the principles of software craftsmanship and we'll also help you get your first job. We've graduated over 600 students into their dream jobs as junior developers." I am one of those.

  cohort_year: 2016
  categories:
    - career-changers
    - women
  case_study:
   - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
     answer: I was a cancer biologist - doing research for Cancer Research UK
   - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
     answer: I've always been interested in computers. In biology, the outcomes are always so vague and open to different interpretation. I was yearning for a craft that was clear cut, and a career allowed me to be creative. In software, the code either works or it doesn't - that sort of certainty, the immediacy of running code - that was a big pull for me.
   - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
     answer: I was researching coding bootcamps in London, and aside from being situated right in the heart of Tech City, I was really attracted by the long list of hiring partners that Makers Academy have built. After reading a bunch of student blogs, being inspired by all the awesome careers their grads were starting, I decided - if they could do it, why shouldn't I?
   - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
     answer: The hardest parts of my Makers Academy experience came in the group work - you're thrown into a class with so many different people, getting to work with a wide variety of personalities, with different rhythms, working styles, learning speeds... My challenge was maintaining harmony with those I didn't immediately vibe with - which is no small feat when you're pairing 24/7!
   - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
     answer: I applied for 2 companies that pitched at the careers fair, and I independently to a few companies too. Both hiring partners from the careers fair made me an offer a few weeks after graduation, but so too did my first choice, who I obviously accepted! It was about 6 weeks from graduation to signing my contract :)
   - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
     answer: In general, I'm really excited by what life has in store for me. I've got my dream job now, which I start on Monday, and I can't wait! I've got a job at the company I always wanted to work for, I'm excited about the future of technology, and I'm especially excited that I get to be part of creating that future. Life's never been so exciting.
   - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
     answer: Just do it!
   - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
     answer: Well, the salary you can get after graduation makes it totally worthwhile. It pays for itself in a year or two, so if you're serious about changing your career, the investment is worth every penny.
   - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
     answer: Before I started, my biggest fear was the idea of pairing 24/7. The thoughts of having to spend all day every day talking to people was intimidating. I quickly realised that, in fact, pairing is just 2 people working together with the same aims - to make the code work and learn as much as possible. It forced me out of my comfort zone, and noticeably improved my communication. In the end it, it turned out to be one of the best parts of my experience.
   - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
     answer: The best thing I've ever done. Best decision I ever made! I made friends in my cohort that will be friends for life.

#    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
#      answer: The rapid pace of change from subject to subject. It was a bit of a struggle. Every week you're learning a new thing.
#    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
#      answer: Did hiring week at Makers which was very helpful. From there, I went to a few career fairs to find a sense of where I belonged. After that, I decided to launch some of my own projects and helped other people with their side projects too. I had regular weekly meetings with Makers to make sure I was keeping up with the hiring process, and I recently received a job offer.
#    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
#      answer: It's become a bit less intense. Its much more focused on work now. Its still been busy doing this and focusing on side projects as well.
#    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
#      answer: Research. Research yourself more than anything. Work out what you want to do based on your passions and skills. Then research facilities out there that can help you accomplish your goals.
#    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
#      answer: It is expensive, you're not wrong. But there's not a price you can put on the education. Be aware of the risk. It paid off for me. If you want it to work, you have to take that plunge.
#    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
#      answer: That I would finish the course then go back to my old career. Fortunately, that hasn't happened. It's all worked out very well.
#    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
#      answer: It was well worth doing. It was worth the time and worth the expense. I've learned so much about programming, but more importantly myself.

    - women
  case_study:
   - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
     answer: I was working in education as an administrator
   - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
     answer: I was interested in development in EdTech and I was looking for a new challenge.
   - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
     answer: I was looking for evening classes in coding and saw Makers Academy, then the idea stuck. I read a lot of blogs from previous students and saw other people had come from other backgrounds, turned their life around. Seeing how other people had done it made me want to join.
   - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
     answer: The pace of the course was really hard to keep up with. I came with 0 knowledge of tech or any relevant industry so it was a bit harder for me. The PreCourse was hard - I hate Chris Pine with a passion. You always face the weekend challenges at the start of the weekend thinking "Crap!" but I surprised myself with how much I was able to do.
   - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
     answer: I started applying for jobs straight away and going to loads of meetups. I coached at Codebar and Rails Girls and found I was able to help people. I was able to remember what it was like not knowing much and relate to the people learning. It took around 8 - 9 weeks to get a job through the careers. I applied for a few jobs on my own and the companies didn't know what to expect. I generally found the first stages of interviews quite easy and interesting. Most companies I approached myself didn't know what Makers was. One or two were okay - a few were a complete disaster. I finally got a job at MoJ with the help of the careers team.
   - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
     answer: Completely. It's so different from working in admin / education. I'm able to keep learning constantly. I'm happier to have a new challenge and excited to start a new job. I'm involved in Women Hack for Non-Profits so I'm learning Python and Django.
   - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
     answer: If you've done the research and got the instinct to go for it - just do it.
   - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
     answer: It is! So definitely do your research. Talk to previous students and work out a budget. I tried to get used to living on a little less and being a bit more frugal.
   - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
     answer: Whether I'd be able to keep up and getting a job. I think it was amazing. you spend the entire 12 weeks trying to keep up and worrying. You just got to hang in there and Makers always said everyone who wants a job will get one and that proved to be true.
   - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
     answer: Amazing, fun & not for the faint hearted.

#    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
#      answer: Store Manager
#    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
#      answer: Doing something I loved as a job. I wanted to have a positive impact on the world.
#    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
#      answer: I was told from my brother about bootcamps, then did some research on them in the London area. Makers offered the best opportunities, and they were confident in getting their students jobs.
#    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
#      answer: Finding a way to explain things. Sometimes you think you understand things. Sometimes you don't get them right away. Communicating my ideas, and being an efficient communicator was the hardest challenge for me.
#    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
#      answer: After graduation I slept quite a lot. I relied on the Makers team network for job hunting. I contacted a few companies outside of the Makers network, but didn't find much. I work at Pharma Digital now. It took about a month after graduation to receive my job offer there.
#    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
#      answer: I still have a lot of change to come, like moving and a new career. I am now more confident because I know I can code, approach problems, and overall I'm just happy with the direction my life is going.
#    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
#      answer: Make sure its really what you want, then give it your all. Once you start, you really need to work and be aware that it will be worth it. Don't expect to be handed a job by doing nothing. Work hard and plan for it.
#    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
#      answer: It is a lot of money. Its hard to put a price on an opportunity and the ability to change your career. To me it was well worth it.
#    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
#      answer: I was confident, but there was a fear of not getting a job, and not being able to manage emotions. You just need to be patient when job hunting.
#    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
#      answer: Makers was great because I could work everyday with other people who were very driven and had the same goals that I had. It helped me focus, work hard, and learn as much as I could.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Before Makers Academy I was an analyst for a bank.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Someone came into my work and they automated a lot of stuff using VBA and it blew my mind. At that point I thought my job was under threat, if someone can come along and do that then it wouldn't take long until it was expected for me to have that skill. I was worried that I was going to be out of a job without that skill.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: "It came up on Facebook and at the time I was learning VBA. I was learning it on my own: I had no one to give me guidance. I knew the code I was writing was a bit sloppy, so I thought I'd want more formal training – but not to the extent of going to university. From what I've read about Computer Science at university it doesn't prepare you as well for getting an actual job."
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I found pairing every day tricky. It's stressful. I think one of the most difficult things is to figure out that you are not going to learn everything. You need to learn to be patient and trust that you will eventually understand.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I went travelling for 2 weeks. When I came back I was furiously job searching. I got an interview at Springer, which I put all my energy into preparing for as I knew it was a good company. It paid off as I got a job there!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I now know I have a huge interest in coding. I'm still doing it in my free time even without someone telling me to do it.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: You have to commit to it! You have to be patient with the fact that it's not going to pay off straight away and you might not get a job straight away, so make sure you have some savings to keep you going.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Would I be completely be able to change career within four months of doing a course? It's paid off, so it comes down to putting all the effort in.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It has changed the direction of my career. Everyone at Makers has been really helpful, especially on the Ronin side of things. it's defo been good value for money.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: My most recent job was being an IT helpdesk coordinator.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I worked at the reception for Level 39, a technology accelerator. I saw what everyone was doing there and wanted to get involved! I moved to the IT department there but it wasn't enough.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I heard about Makers from pretty much everywhere! I knew there were coding bootcamps out there and when I spoke to people at events, Makers Academy was the first everyone mentioned. It seemed like everything was pointing me towards it.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I found my commute super-difficult. It was about 2 hours each way.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was selected to be an Alumni Helper and that was a great experience. It made me deal with lots of different technologies and it was interesting as well as difficult. It was great to get to know the juniors a bit better – and not having to leave!
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: I'd say "do it"! Do some coding and online code courses to check if you like and enjoy coding. It's definitely the best thing I've ever done – if anything I wish I hadn't waited. Prepare first - make sure you're in a position to afford to do it as you don't want to waste any time while you are here.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: I think it is real value for money. It sets you up for a career change, that is a huge-value item. To go from receptionist to developer in 3 months! If anything the course being short is a good thing as you pack so much in.
    - question: "What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?"
      answer: "My biggest fear was that I would not be any good at coding. I think that's what everyone is frightened of! At the end of the day, practice is major point of coding. It's like writing: keep at it and you'll get there. Also, don't expect yourself to be a computer prodigy! You see Mr Robot and you'll be like \"I'll never be that good\", but no one needs to be that good. There is a lot of code that needs to be written, so there is room for everybody."

    - Entrepreneur
    - remote
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I had been running a geomatics consultancy I setup a couple of years previous and I was looking to integrate more web / cloud / IoT techniques and deliverables in our portfolio and into our processes in general.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Being in an industry constantly dealing with data, I had always had an interest in coding as a way to not be constrained by the software I was using and being able to solve the problems I was working on. Initially it was playing around with scripts in GIS software and their connected databases and then writing standalone programs for specific tasks. I loved the idea of web based technologies but had no idea where to start as it was much wider and more daunting than what I had tackled before.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I attended a charity weekend hosted by MA for Tech Bikers and found out about MA then. The team were awesome and decided to try and find a way to do it around running my company. The first Remote cohort was advertised and this seemed like an ideal opportunity that was more feasible to me than re-locating to London at the time.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Remembering to lift my head up and pickup the big picture once in a while, rather than focusing on the macro concepts of the day and hence not understanding how concepts fitted together. I didn’t do this often enough, the learning outcomes introduced later in the course helped me towards identifying this. I now find it very useful in accelerating my progression.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: It became even busier! I re-joined the business and spent a few weeks doing all the company stuff that I had put off during Makers. At the same time I was keen to start using my new skills. We were just going into trialling a new virtual environment technology for geo-data communication, so I was able to set about an agile process to prototype a cloud delivery method that we now use in production, it was a real boost to have a real world project that was returning revenue in such a short period of time and one that combined my skills in the geomatics industry with my new coding skill set.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I absolutely love the fact that I am now able to take ideas we have as a company and act fast on iterating these to prototype and potentially onto deliverable / product / tool. I've always had the sticking point before of being able to conceptualise the idea, but then struggle to know where to start on implementing it. The focus on Agile Methodologies at Makers along with the coding and the focus on Software Craftsmanship means I have some confidence that while junior at this I am building self documenting, maintainable codebases. It means I can bring outside developers in for senior support/guidance and eventually grow the team in-house without having to set about projects again from the start.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Ensure you enjoy coding, try it out - there are plenty of online resources & hopefully you’ll find a passion for problem solving. Then commit 100% to it. It’s an intense environment and you will need all your energy, effort and focus to get the most out of it.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: Look at what other training you can get for £8000, commercially it’s very little (I quite easily, in my industry, spend £300-£500 for technical training for employees per day), in terms of University £8000 doesn’t go far. Also why not investigate Remote for a lower cost option which is half the price!
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was worried that stepping away from my business for 4 months would not be sustainable. It turns out that with the right planning and support it was probably one of the best things to do, as it gave me a new perspective and expanded the potential of the business.

    - question: What made yo u want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had been working a lot with technology and edtech products and I was seeing how technology is changing the educational industry, so I was reading alot about how learning to code was the thing everyone was doing. I started learning to code online and I did a week long front end course and loved it and realised it was something I wanted to be doing full-time
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I started to do some research and Makers Academy stood out as the best option.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace of the course and the number of new concepts. Everytime it feels like you have handle on something you got to move onto something new. It feels like you are wailing through quicksand trying to get your head around this mad stuff.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I mainly went through the careers team at Makers to apply to opportunities. It moved very quickly. The Wednesday of hiring week we visited another company. We had to learn Java in 4 days and did more tech tests and interviews. I got an offer from there but I was working on Thoughtworks tech test and was waiting on that so I ended up rejecting my first offer while waiting for ThoughtWorks to come through as I really wanted that.

      answer: You would be hard pushed to find any other course that is good value money. If you look it's less than a price of a year at university and is more vocational and more job ready and even if you are not going in as developer. It's still a very useful skill to have and be able to understand and connect with them on a different kind of level.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was most scared of not being able to do it as I'm not technical nor do I come from a maths background. It was hard but aslong as I spent time working at it, I found it to be possible so that when I came across things that were difficult that I knew I would be able to understand them given enough time.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It's changed the way I see the world and how I approach problems! I definitely feel empowered.

  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2015
  categories: career changer
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was an English and Maths tutor.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Two things, I wanted a more intellectually challenging and rewarding career and my best friend who is a front-end developer had told me for years I should try programming. I eventually listened!
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I felt I had two options, a CS Masters degree for career-changers or a development bootcamp. After I researched and saw a lot of recommendations on switchup.org, student blogs, and on the Makers website, I went with Makers. For me it was clearly the most intense and the most thorough.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I found it difficult to balance my desire to know everything immediately with my sanity! There is so much to learn!
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I spent the first 6 weeks after I graduated as an alumni helper and then really focused on the job hunt. I applied and applied and accepted a job as a junior software developer at Surfdome.

    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: Judge for yourself if it's worth it. You normally get a starting salary of around £32k for a Junior Developer. Equivalent masters courses are about the same price and this is a highly selective course so for me it made sense and coming out of the course I found the syllabus content and methodoligies to be worth it 100%.
    - question: What as your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would not be able to get a job and I now have one!
      answer: This expression is a little over-used, but Makers Academy can be life-changing!

    - startup
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a journalist and editor for 20+ years working on a variety of publications, covering politics and finance among other topics.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Journalism is being transformed by web technologies and I found myself increasingly interested in the technical side of things rather than providing content. Also after 20 years in the trade I felt it was time for a new challenge.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I heard about Makers Academy through a friend of mine who was involved in the Shoreditch tech industry a few years ago. It seemed ideal in terms of the curriculum and geared towards people with unusual backgrounds looking to change career.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The second half was the hardest, grappling with frameworks like Rails and Angular. That part of the course was a bit hectic I thought, and I often felt a bit at sea. I think I'm instinctively more of a pure coder than a framework user, if that distinction makes sense. I'm sure it was the other way round for many others on the course though!
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I hit the Christmas lull shortly after graduating so it was pretty slow. Spent a couple of months doing tech tests and applications. All the applications I made were via Makers. Accepted an offer at PensionBee in February and started there last week.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: It's busy! Been a while since I've had a fulltime 9-5 office job (as opposed to freelancing or doing shifts). Am thoroughly enjoying it though.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it! You won't regret it. Coding is a lot easier than people think it is and it's a profession with a future where your skills will always be in demand (the same alas is no longer true of journalism).
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: You'll make the money back pretty quickly when you start work. Get a Careers Development Loan if you can. Though it would be good if Makers Academy offered more bursaries.
    - question: What as your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I wouldn't "fit in" in tech culture and that my unusual career background would count against me when jobhunting. But it turns out the tech industry is full of oddballs with unusual backgrounds, so this worry was more about my own private hang-ups than being based in anything objective.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Exhilarating, intense, stimulating.

  categories:
    - career changer
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I had been working as a Country Manager in online marketing for mobile telecom and online betting companies.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had been doing short courses in the past, but that was never enough to get into a proper coding job. I wanted something more creative - building prototypes, less business meetings, actionable approaches to actually building stuff from scratch
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy through Google and I have been to a couple of graduation days to get the sense of the experience students were going through.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I decided to spend two months reviewing material and focusing more on front-end and JavaScript. I applied for jobs and the first  one I got was as a Web Analyst. It proved not to be exactly what I expected, so kept searching until I landed a job as Junior UI Developer for Immediate Media, a big online publishing company.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: The Makers Academy experience gave me a lot of confidence that I can learn quickly and changed the way I learn into a healthy dose of experimenting and breaking things. I also adopted a mentality of not being afraid to make mistakes constantly, which is the only way to learn. Finally, I got an interesting job, great career prospects and an extremely stimulating work environment and people.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Trust your gut feeling, play with Codecademy's simple tutorials to see if writing code gives you actual buzz.
    - question: What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: It is expensive but this is less than what you would pay for a year of studies which won’t get you a job. This is an investment, a way to get into an exciting and booming industry where your skills will be hugely in demand, and not only in the UK. As a mental exercise, you can divide the sum by the months, number of weeks and days you will be sitting for 8 hours coding with fellow Makers, if you do your maths you will see that the hourly price is actually a bargain.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Very hard work but life changing experience. Some of us were miserable, but kept going and pushing ourselves. Keep positive and never feel bad about not knowing something, try to explore as much as you can. Experiment and persevere, you will find your feet soon.

    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?

    - education leaver
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was at university doing a degree in history but I was there just because it’s what everyone does. I didn't want to go down the usual path of getting a job in the City and hence decided to join Makers Academy.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Coding was always a hobby of mine and I wanted to kick-start it properly as I realized I wanted a career that I enjoy doing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: A lot of Google searching and Makers Academy came out as one of the best ones.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: What I found difficult during the course was staying positive through out it. I was at Makers Academy from 9am to about 7pm every day and I was knackered by the end of it. I also found riding the highs and lows difficult.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Directly after graduating I relaxed for a week and then I started to apply for lots of jobs. I got my first interview through Makers Academy and got a job offer.

  cohort_month: July
  cohort_year: 2015
  categories:
    - career changer
    - startup
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I'd worked in the sports betting industry for a number of years, most recently as an integrity analyst.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I love technology, so that was a good starting point. I did a lot of research into careers I could (realistically) change into that may suit both my skills and interests; and provide me with the work/life satisfaction I was looking for. I have ideas I may want to build into products in the future, and I want technical skills that are future-proof and location independent. Being able to code gives me all of this.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: Targeted advertisements probably! Seriously, though, I was consuming a lot of resources related to career-changing, programming courses and the London tech scene. I'd been aware of a rival boot camp for some time but, having attended both a graduation and sat in on a lecture at Makers prior to my Makers interview, it felt like the place I wanted to be, and I was encouraged by the focus on industry best-practices, which I felt might set me apart in a competitive marketplace. I'd been trying to teach myself via online tutorials but I realised if I really wanted to make this happen I needed to throw myself into it 100% - "go big or go home"!
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: A lot of things! I've never challenged myself mentally like this before and given that my previous education was some time ago too it was really hard to adapt to learning again. When you consider the intensity of a 12-week course in something you have no real prior knowledge of, and that Makers is not run in the traditional (archaic) education style, it was tough to keep up. Makers warn you about all of this but I wasn't comfortable 'failing fast and often', nor was I pro-active enough in getting the help and support I needed. As a result, managing myself and my emotions was a major part of the challenge, and I learnt a lot about myself. What I found easy was the supportive, friendly, open culture at Makers, I felt at home as myself from day one.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was physically and emotionally drained after the final projects and the idea of having to go out into the real world and sell myself filled me with dread. I also graduated in the summer when hiring was really quiet. I had a few interviews but couldn't afford to hang around in London if one didn't come through, and as I also felt low on confidence I opted to take some time out to consolidate my learning. A couple of months later I restarted applying for jobs and secured one in just two weeks.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I'm about to start my first job as a Junior Developer, and it's the most excited I've ever been about a new job in nearly ten years of employment. I'm happier, I've made new friends and strengthened existing relationships, and I'm passionate about becoming a good developer.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Don't be rash but do be brave. Research, ask questions, weigh up pros and cons and then DO IT! (and believe that you can). If your current career gives you the Monday blues consider how that might feel for another 40 years. If you want to work in an industry with cool, honest, intelligent people, where working environments are fun and job prospects are great then learning to code is an excellent choice. If you choose a bootcamp then set yourself up for success, be financially stable for several months after the course, shelve your other commitments for that period of time (this will need 100% of your time and energy) and give it everything you've got.
    - question: What you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?
      answer: It's undoubtedly a significant sum of money but it's an investment in yourself. A Computer Science degree would set you back that amount each year, and Makers produces better coders. Within 6 to 12 months of starting the course most people are in a job earning money, and for me I'm earning more than I did in my last career in my very first job, with dramatically better earning potential if I keep improving.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I worried I was being ridiculous to think I could achieve this, that I wouldn't get a job afterwards and that I'd end up worse off than I was when I was miserable in my uninspiring previous career. I made myself publicly accountable by quitting a job and telling all my friends and family what I was doing, and I took a considerable financial risk. The support I got during the process and the words of congratulations I got having secured a job made it worth the struggle, and then some. I've proved to myself that I do have the ability, and most importantly the drive and determination to succeed, and that makes me immensely happy and proud. Like the majority of the workforce a lot of my friends are unhappy in the jobs they do, so hopefully my achievement will encourage them to break out of their comfort zone and make a change too.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I used to be a lawyer and worked in project finance.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had a feeling I might enjoy it so I started to play with it online and then I got to a point where I felt like I wouldn't progress more and not learn more so I looked online and found Makers Academy.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: There is a lot to learn and it was sometimes difficult to keep on top of everything, especially knowing there was something completely new coming each week. It was challenging getting used to that feeling of not finishing things and feeling okay to move on to the next thing.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I chilled out for a week and took a bit of a break and then I started work on my CV and immediately after the job fair my CV started to get sent out. Very quickly after I graduated I was being encouraged to apply.  I went on the trip to Brno to take part in a recruitment hackathon and then I had a crazy week of interviews. I then started to find out I had job offers and I took several days to decide which job to take and I then accepted my job at the Financial Times.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: My life has changed a lot because I am now in this world of coders, talking and thinking about programming all the time. It's a surprisingly active community with loads of meetups centred around different languages. It's taken over my life in a good way. I've become fully absorbed in this world of code.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: For me Makers Academy has been the best decision ever. It took me from one career to another in a short space of time. If you are thinking of doing Makers Academy, be ready for it to take over your life, and be prepared to give it all of your energy for a few months.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: When I was applying I did think it was expensive, but if you are thinking of studying again to change career, compare it to a masters or university course. It might seem relatively expensive because it's a short course, but conversely it’s actually better value. You start earning and making that money back again sooner than you would with a longer course.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: It felt like a huge risk because I was diving into something I might or might not have ended up being good at. But I'm really glad I took that risk and I think Makers Academy is an incredible environment to learn in. You don't just learn to code here - you also have lots of fun and meet great people. You also have an amazing support network of expert developers, and wellbeing support.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It's intense, challenging but amazing.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a cardiology doctor.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I feel that a lot of technologies are disrupting old industries (like black cabs) but I felt that medicine has not been disrupted by technology yet. I feel the disruption however coming and I wanted to be the forefront of it and guiding it. In my day-to-day work there is a lot of inefficiency that can be made better with technology and applications. I wanted to make my own applications to improve my workflow and deliver better patient care.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: It was hard to learn how to learn again as I got used to being a senior in medicine.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I used my academic time to do this course. I'm now re-entering medicine as a registrar and I'm going to be communicating with the ICT departments of my hospital and some private medical tech companies to see if we can collaborative on solutions for problems I face day to day. I didn't expect to use the network opportunity I have here with the alumni network.  I can penetrate the bureaucracy a bit more easily in the NHS as I now understand medicine and tech.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I can code and it doesn't scare me anymore. I can think of anything new I wanted do and know eventually I know can build it.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Don't be afraid it of it and take the leap. You'll never feel more alive and gain so much and it's been such an incredible experience in my life. If you are not satisfied with your job, you'll never convince yourself to be satisfied and if you want to be fulfilled then take the leap and don't be afraid of the consequences.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was due to have been out of education for over 6 years, I wondered if I would be able to pick up a new skill, let alone coding. When you learn something new it is hard but if you've been through university or a done scientific degree then you probably already have an aptitude for picking up programming and don’t underestimate your communication skills as being a people person is important due to pair programming and working in teams.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a full time Mum for 7 years and before that I had my own franchise business.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always loved tech and I was curious about code. A friend of mine said I should consider doing it as a career.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy through a bootcamp review website. I was deciding between Makers and GA. GA felt too international and a numbers game. Makers on the other hand felt non-salesy and genuine and I liked that.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I had a lot of guilt as my mind was on the course so much that I didn't get to spend much quality time with my children, and any spare time I had I spent it coding. I also had to keep pushing through the times where I felt so stupid.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I carried on working on my code. Mergermarket was my 7th interview. It was difficult as I wanted to always do more but being a Mum I chose to spend more time with the kids, and that slowed my progress. I also needed to build my confidence. So it took a while. I had a lot of disappointing interviews, I'd give myself a few days and go back to coding and I kept attending Makers and got lots of support which is very special.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I feel much more confident. I'm more confident as a developer and I got a job! My family is just so proud of me.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: That everything you do is a risk. Life is full of risks and this is no different. This industry is not going anywhere and it is recession-proof. Job-wise you will be able to get a job at the end of the day, and if you love code there is no reason not to.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It's an investment in yourself and to be honest, it's quite cheap in the long run. It's not about the cash but it's also about you as a person and you are gaining a skill that will be useful for at least another 40 or so years. It's a bargain.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was that I wouldn't get a job, and up until last week that is how I felt, but I got a job! I was also worried if I was too old to change careers, and yes it took a long time, but I got a job and no, I was not too old. I kept at it and got lots of encouragement from the Makers Academy team.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Probably the best experience of my life!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be comfortable in people seeing your code. Test-drive your code and be yourself. One of my friends, Dave, from my cohort said, "Just relax and remember how much you love coding."

      answer: I was working as a International Public Relations Manager.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I realised I really enjoyed  using formulas in Excel sheets, and more generally I missed breaking down problems through logical thinking, which I had to do as a student when doing Maths.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I found out about MA through a simple Google ad, and followed up with ample online research. I decided to apply because the idea of reaching an employable level after 12 weeks meant becoming a developer was no longer an unreachable dream, but could become a very tangible project.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Realising that I didn't only need to learn about coding but also about efficiently  researching what I needed to solve a problem and I had to become very resilent.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation, I went on several interviews and found a position as a Junior Developer for Government Digital Service. I'm very lucky to be in a team that is truly Agile and supports my learning through mentorship, a 20% project and more
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: In my old job, I used to have the Monday morning blues and felt like I was dragging myself to work every morning. Things are now very different, I am excited about the challenges I face, and I am building something that many real people use, I get to code and learn every day.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster, but it's definitely worth it to find a job you love.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was not finding a job after Makers. It took me about 2 months of searching, which isn't that much for a first job, but it felt much longer. Glad I stuck in there!
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: So very happy I decided to do it. Learning to be a developer is a journey with many ups and downs; I alternatively felt empowered by knowing new tools and being able to build what I imagined, with feeling like it was so hard and I could never understand. Thankfully being with a group of people who go through the same thing, as well as getting support from Makers staff - both coding and emotional support (encouragements, yoga, karaoké nights!) helped a lot. It gave me the skills I needed to keep learning by myself, and lasting connections with other people who are also passionate about coding.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster, but it's definitely worth it to find a job you love.

      answer: I found out through friends and people who did the course before and applied based on their recommendations.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: What I found difficult is knowing what your level is when you finish the course and how you measure up against other junior developers from other backgrounds.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I was applying for jobs whilst being an alumni helper and doing some freelance work, and then I got a Junior Developer role at Product Health.

      answer: I've got a new job and I'm doing more stuff that I'll ultimately like.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Have a very specific target in mind and by that I mean understand that you really know what you are getting into. Think it through and think about why you are doing it, not just because coding is fashionable. Also build and budget for more than 3 months!
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive depending on what you want to do. If I wanted to start my own thing today it would cost me at least £10k and I wouldn't understand the technologies, and I'd also have to bring in a technical co-founder, but joining Makers Academy is cheaper for my startup and I'm more informed. You now pay so much money to go to university so the relative cost is minimal and you get the careers service support too.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?

    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I thought I would have to go back to technical writing before I could get a job as a Junior Developer but I got the job.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Check if there are other ways to improve your technical abilities before you think code is right for you and if it is then it's a great thing to do.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is. I have actually learnt to self-teach myself through Makers Academy even though I've been trying to learn to code for the last 8 years which gives you that push.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I think I was terrified if I would be able to do it. I think Dana (our Chief Joy Officer) and the environment help with us overcome that feeling.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It was a lot of work and a lot of fun!

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a Personal Banking Advisor at Lloyds Bank.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: A friend mentioned that I should give it a try, I did a few online courses on HTML & CSS and instantly fell in love.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I Googled "Programming courses in London" and it was one of the top results.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I misjudged how much work I would need to put in to keep up with the pace of the course, so I was playing catch up on some of the earlier concepts as the weeks went by. I should have been asking way more questions, it's really intimidating asking good programmers simple questions even in my current job. I wish I had got it in my head that no question is a stupid question as long as you've tried solving it yourself and can prove it.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: A friend recommend me for a job at his workplace 2 weeks before graduation. I went in for an interview and received an offer on the table.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I have a new job which is better pay than my previous job and is way more challenging than anything I've ever done in a good way. My new job has an awesome start-up culture. I have new friends a better social life  and I am now a ping pong master. My life has completely changed since joining Makers Academy. Best decision I've ever made.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you're sure the coding world is for you, it could be the best decision you'll ever make. If you're willing to put the work in then it will change your life forever.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is a large sum of money, but it is worth it.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My worry was along the lines of "What if I can't get a job after the course is finished and I threw away my previous job?". I landed a job before I even finished the course. I guess that goes to show how in demand programmers are in this day and age.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Makers Academy is really fun but also very challenging. It gave me a new life so I couldn't be happier with my experience.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: My advice would be to make a portfolio website, blog about cool stuff you come across and make stuff - no matter how basic (stop binging on tutorial websites and don't be afraid of the unknown).

      answer: I was working in Operations and Finance as an intern for a charity in Oxford.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: A lot of my friends are coders and they thought it would be something I'd be good at so I tried it out and it made me want to learn more.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I looked at ways of learning to code and thought a bootcamp was for me and it seemed like Makers was the best one so I applied.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I found the pace of learning difficult and also the state of not knowing what to do most the time was also quite demotivating. It was just as hard as I expected it to be.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I started applying to jobs straight away. Most the jobs I applied to were through Makers. I got one job offer fairly quickly but I rejected it. I had other rejections and I applied to Deloitte and although I got rejected first time around, I was given a second chance and got accepted.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I have a new job!
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?

      answer: It is expensive but it's a good investment. I don't think I would have been able to get my current job and salary for a while without doing this course.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Biggest worry was that I would not get a job but I got a job! I was also worried I would not like coding but I do!

    - acast
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: My background is in client management and analyst roles. Just before Makers, I was working as a Project Management intern for a startup and as a Project Coordinator in a Charity.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: It is always useful to know how to code, it is the future.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: Googling. I wanted a change and Makers was the solution to being able to make it fast.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The intensity. Every week we were leaving behind something to learn something else.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Just after the graduation, my brain was on strike for two weeks. After that I kept studying on my own while I was searching for a job. For the first few weeks the job market was very quiet but suddenly it woke up and lots of opportunities came up. I am working now as a Web Application Developer.
    - question: How has life changed since graduation?
      answer: I am constantly challenged and I learn new things everyday.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it! If you don't take a risk you will regret it all your life and if it goes wrong, at least you tried.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I had two worries - one was that I could not be 100% sure I was going to love coding as a profession, and if I would be able to cope with the intensity (energy wise, as I have a B12 deficiency when I joined). After the course I can say I love coding and being able to create things. I took care of myself during the course and I could cope with my energy, in fact my B12 was perfect after the course.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Intense but worth it.

    - acast
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was managing the marketing functions for a legal recruitment company.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I always wanted to learn to code and I kept doing the marketing thing but realised I still wanted to learn to code. I was speaking to a friend who connected me to Nikesh who was doing the course at the time and that convinced me.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I knew Nikesh so I applied to both GA and Makers Academy but the actual interview process for Makers convinced me that Makers was the better choice. It gave me an insight into the course and I liked the atmosphere and vibe. I read a lot of blogs from students and that all convinced me.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The intensity of the course is difficult and relentless. There are so many moments where you think you are stupid but you have no choice but to keep going at it until you get it.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was an alumni helper for a few months. I worked on a couple of paid freelance projects while job hunting and kept learning. I now have a job at Deloitte Digital.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: My life has changed completely because in real terms my career has completely changed and I’ve got a great group of friends that came out of Makers. Doing the course hits your confidence but weirdly makes you much more confident.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Make sure you do your research and make sure you budget so that you can take time to pick your dream job, but at the same time don’t overthink the choice.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive, but I don’t regret a single pound I spent as it has made so many things possible for me. I know if I tried to do it on my own I would not have gotten there quickly and would not be in the position that I am in now. A big thing that is underestimated is the large network that comes out of Makers Academy.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I left an 8 year career so I kept wondering if I was making a big mistake to start all over again. I’m so happy with my decision. It was risky but worth it.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Probably the best experience of my life! Crazy. Intense. Awesome.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Get yourself out there as soon as possible so you start to practice your interview skills and gain confidence in a new world for you.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a waiter for a catering company.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Well, programming was fun and catering wasn't. It was really the whole problem solving aspect of coding that was really fun and got me into it.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: My brother showed it to me, and I didn't think I'd get in so I just submitted an application without much thought.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace. The constant projects and having to start a new one directly after finishing one was hard, it wears you down, but you definitely learn a lot.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I became an alumni helper, and then after a couple weeks I was flown out to the Czech Republic for a recruitment hackathon with a couple of other people from my cohort. I ended up getting a job there!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: Definitely for the better, I'm moving to Brno and couldn't be more excited.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. It definitely worked out for the best.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I'll be making twice as much as I was before the course so it's definitely a decent investment.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Honestly, I was worried about being able to hang around and be social with a large group of people for 10 hours a day, everyday, but now I can do that easily. As surprising as it is, a computer camp really improved my people skills.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: I quickly developed Stockholm syndrome for code and the people here.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Apparently we're worth hiring. I had no clue after the course that we would actually be on par with people who spent years at university, but we definitely are judging by how people keep hiring us.

      answer: In January I graduated from university where I studied Communication.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?

      answer: I came across Makers Academy on Google and I applied because it looked like exactly what I wanted.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I worked at Makers Academy as an Alumni Helper. Then Makers found me a job at FNZ in the Czech Republic after we went to a recruitment hackathon there which was awesome. FNZ showed us around and paid for our meals and beers, and then gave me a job with a great relocation package.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: If you want to learn to code then Makers Academy is worth it.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a project manager for a company that did home automation.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Lots of the tech we installed needed programming. Due to a shortage of people at the company capable of doing such programming, I started commissioning a little bit at the end of jobs and I enjoyed that more than what I was doing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: My girlfriend came across Makers Academy. I had made the decision to get into software development and I didn't know about bootcamps. I started to learn during evenings and took a part-time evening course for 6 weeks. After my first 2 hour evening session here at Makers, I realised that I had learned more at Makers than I did in that whole part-time course.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Initially, some concepts were difficult, but the hardest thing was managing my social life. I had met someone before the course who had previously done it and I put my life on hold for 3 months, which was difficult.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: During graduation, lots of employers were wandering around. I talked with one who is now my boss. After graduation, I stayed at Makers Academy every day for 6 weeks and became an alumni helper. I got the job offer at Atos Consulting 3-4 weeks later.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: In nearly every way, and all for the better. I am now enjoying work and getting to work with cool people. I'm just a lot happier than I was before.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. If you're thinking about it, it means you aren't happy where you are, so just do it. Especially if you are younger, then you shouldn't think twice.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is more than £8,000 with living costs, but there's a big difference between cost and value for me. It will be the best investment I will ever make. An investment in your education is one that continues to pay you back.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Getting a job afterwards. From my experiences, since graduating from Makers I feel that there are more jobs out there than Makers Academy will ever be able to fill. There are more shitty devs out there than is possible, and Makers Academy students come out so skilled that it continues to amaze our employers. We know better practices than senior devs.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Best decision I ever made.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Don't compromise your values for the sake of money. If you come in looking for a specific job, don't take the first one you get just because you are worried you won't get a job. You will be a valuable dev in a short space of time and there will be more than one offer coming your way.

    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?

    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The work load and realisation of how much you're expected to learn, at first, was difficult to process. But you find out it's so much fun and you enjoy and look forward to every new task you get.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was sceptical about getting a job and didn't want to leave Makers Academy at first, but hiring week was very useful and helped me boost my confidence. So I was super excited when I had my first interview only about a month after graduation and I got the job, which is even better!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I was stuck after finishing college with no intentions to go uni, in a job I hated. Now I feel like I've learned so much, met so many awesome people, and got a job doing something I love along the way.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was at the University of York where I studied Environmental Geography.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I was playing around in Codecademy, and in my degree I enjoyed the modules that involved computers.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy a year before I actually applied, but back then I thought it wasn't for me and I couldn't hack it. But when I came across it again I just decided to go for it, and figure it out as I went along.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Being comfortable with not knowing everything was hard, but it led me to work harder.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: So after graduation I spent more than a month working on my code until Will and Ruben encouraged me to start applying for jobs. That is what I found the most scary, that I loved to code but I didn't know where I fit in. I then worked as an Alumni helper while applying to jobs and I did a couple of tech tests, but my first interview was with Deloitte Digital where I landed a job.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: My life now revolves around coding! I'm looking forward to starting my career.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I was considering doing a masters in Computer Science but actually it's less time and money, and you learn more at Makers in short space of time. It's the best investment I ever made.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: It felt like a risk. I really enjoyed coding and I never coded full time so I had no idea if I could make a career out of it. I was also worried that not having industry experience would hold me back even more.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Amazing.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Prepare as much as possible and try and relax. In hindsight I would have started to apply for jobs earlier.

#     - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
#       answer: Before Makers Academy I was working in a Fashion Tech Startup doing a bit of everything, but my job title was business development. I went there straight from uni where I studied International Politics at Kings College.
#     - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
#       answer: I had interest in it when I was studying politics and when I was working with the developers in the startup I got rather envious seeing what they can do.
#     - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
#       answer: I lacked confidence in my coding capabilities.
#     - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
#       answer: After graduation I started to build on my personal projects and ideas and rebuilt my final project as we wanted to re-launch it. Then started to meet clients and started to pick up freelance work, which kept me coding everyday.
#     - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
#       answer: I work in a completely new industry. I didn't necessarily feel like a developer at graduation, but now I do even though it's only been a few months. I found the career path I want to pursue.
#     - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
#       answer: If you want to you should. If you are not happy where you are then seek to do something that makes you happier. No fear.
#     - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
#       answer: It's a reasonable amount of money for the value of the skill you gain while you are here and it doesn't take long to pay off.
#     - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
#       answer: That I would be terrible at coding. I don't think I'm ever going to say I'm great at it, but I see myself as a developer.
#     - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
#       answer: Amazing. Intense. Quite life changing.

  summary: Online Marketing Manager to Junior Developer at Mergermarket
  testimonial: Makers Academy is challenging and intense, but full of rewards!

    - female
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as an Online Marketing Manager for multi-million dollar businesses.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always been interested in tech ever since I was young, especially video games. I then started my career as an Online Marketing Manager which was a way to combine both my business studies and tech. I used to work with tech teams and really enjoyed it - sometimes I found myself trying to help them despite not having any knowledge. Over time, I became more and more interested in learning about the technical side of marketing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I was researching about coding classes and then I came across Makers Academy. I didn’t want to do a computer science degree as I did not want to spend 3 years to learn the theory only. I already knew I wanted to do web development. I was really impressed with the relationship Makers has with employers so I decided to apply.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The amount of things we had to learn in a small amount of time was difficult. It feels like we have a lot to learn but no time to really digest.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation, I was working as an Alumni helper and now I'm a Developer at Mergermarket.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Take a leap of faith and give it a go. When you enroll, make sure to dedicate a lot of time to the PreCourse as it is really beneficial.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive but it is an investment; what you get out of Makers Academy is not something you can get from online courses.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was that I would not be able to follow the course. During the PreCourse while I was on holiday my computer died, so I didn't get a chance to go through the PreCourse material properly. I still sometimes feel like I'm still going over things but I also feel that the job of a Software Developer is to always be slightly out of your depth and to always be learning new stuff.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Challenging and intense but full of rewards.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Do as many interviews as you can and get as much experience as you can. But know that what we've learnt in 3 months is amazing and people really recognise it. So go out there and try out.

    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I had been looking into coding tutorials and kept seeing adverts and then finally clicked on one. I talked to Jordan and came to visit a couple times before applying.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Keeping up with the speed of the course. Some elements of the course can be challenging, but its the pace that makes it hard.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Graduation was right around Christmas when no one was recruiting. So I practiced my skills for a month and caught up with my family. And after a couple interviews, I ended up at Atos.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I love getting up everyday because I love what I do now. It doesn't feel like work. I enjoy the challenges. A bad day is still a fun day.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you have a gut feeling that this is what you want to do, don't ignore that feeling. Its hard and takes a bit of luck and people will question you, but if you want to combine logic and creativity then you should do it.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is. It's worth it, I am already earning more than I did prior. Makers is a solid investment and just have a look what you'll get out of it!
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Doing tutorials I was finding online and enjoying that didn't necessarily mean I would like doing it everyday. And now I enjoy it.

      answer: Great fun! The best thing I've done in terms of education!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: You've got to prepare as much as possible, but relax and be confident in the interview and show yourself in the best possible light. There were things I didn't know in my interviews but I simply explained what I did know or just asked the interviewer.

    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I first became aware of Makers Academy through a promoted tweet. I then visited a couple of times (a graduation and sat in on a lecture). After seeing the awesome work that the students were capable of delivering at the end of their course and experiencing the culture I decided it would be a great environment in which to learn a new skill.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Before Makers Academy I trained as a historian of gender, education and technology.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Coding is like craft-making, figuring out puzzles, even experimenting in the kitchen, activities I enjoy doing but would never have thought could be related to software engineering. It requires teamwork, imaginative thinking, and curiosity. It’s language- learning, problem-solving and communication all in one - I love it and because of that I got into coding.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I had days when I felt I didn’t have enough time to understand concepts and worries like I won’t be able to get a job, this was all put to bed as after graduation Makers helped me find a job.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: Since graduation I’m happier, more confident, and financially secure. I feel like I’ve found the path I’ve always been looking for and now work as a Junior Developer at Deloitte Digital.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a Senior Project Manager for a telephone betting company I help found 10 years previously.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: As an active problem solver I wanted to expand my knowledge of tools to solve problems and provide useful solutions. I was also was looking for a change of career direction.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I found out about Makers Academy on Google. I attended a graduation and spoke to students and staff at the event and made the decision that the value added by being in the Makers environment would be greater than that which I could achieve on my own.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I got a bit of a mental block during Battleships week and couldn't work out how objects could talk to each other but I quickly got past that. Finding enough time to do all the projects/ideas I want to - this is the curse of a developer though, I fear.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I worked as an Alumni Helper for 6 weeks. This really helped me solidify everything I had learnt on the course. Helping the following cohorts really helped with my learning and knowledge. I applied for several jobs through Makers along with a couple through Silicon Milk Roundabout and then got a job at Alliants.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I am moving forward with my career, learning more and more each day and have the tools and confidence to progress myself and the people that I work with. It also helps that I have found a great company to work for.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you are not happy and are considering changing career - do it now. Better to say 'well, that didn't work' and try something new than wonder 'what if?'
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: A university degree costs £27,000 + 3 years living expenses. Makers costs £8,000 and 6 months living expenses. To learn the same at home on your own would take probably a year and that would also leave you worse off financially and career wise. After a year from starting at Makers Academy you are likely to have 6 months worth of salary and work experience and also the ongoing support of Makers staff and Alumni - this is where the real extra value is added.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would not be good enough and be behind the rest of my cohort and struggle to pick things up and understand. I would say, it does not matter where you are compared to your cohort, it's your journey and everyone learns at different speeds. Any lack of understanding, just ask and keep asking questions. Also, have more confidence in what you are doing, this is a major thing in holding people back - you have more ability than you realise.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It was an awesome time. The 3 months went so quickly. Best decision I could have made. Just wish I was living in London at the time so that I could have been a little more social in the evenings with the rest of my cohort.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Attempt as many technical tests as you can. They will help improve any gaps in your learning. Make sure to keep moving forward and try to overcome learning blocks. Learn new languages/frameworks/approaches. Do not worry about interviews as there are plenty of jobs out there and use all interviews to help improve for the next. If not successful, ask for feedback. Attend anything Will and Sanjay organize. Talk to other job-hunters in your cohort or previous cohorts. Attend meetups and start engaging with the community - you will learn about available jobs and learn about interesting tech that you can then talk about in interviews. Stay positive. Believe in yourself - you are better than you think!

    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?

    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was worried that I couldn't get a job without a degree. Now I see people with degrees not getting the position I've applied for.

      answer: It was one of the best experiences of my life, pair programming with other people without any coding background made me feel more comfortable, and I learnt to break problems into smaller pieces in order to solve them better. The atmosphere was just magic, everyone is so positive and I was shocked after seeing how much I've actually done after 12 weeks (about 10 projects!). I have increased my communication skills by learning to pitch and work in teams. I love Makers and I always will!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Go for the company you like, if you show passion about what you do they don't care about anything else.

  categories:
    - education leaver
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I had just completed my Masters in Financial Economics.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: It was the the urge to build things. I was also inspired during my MSc Dissertation by the affect that Facebook and Twitter have had on the world, especially on real-world issues like corruption perception. They started out as ideas in the minds of people who knew how to code and could bring them to life. That inspired me to learn the skills to build my ideas.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy through Twitter. Having studied business/economics line from O-levels I thought that tech was out of the question for me. But I've always had a passion for tinkering with hardware and software. That promoted tweet got me thinking "maybe its not too late to get into tech".
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace, getting comfortable with not knowing and just trying very hard to understand everything.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I took 2 months off from coding to get married. So I started coding again from March 2015. I practised the Makers material again, I read and practised other tutorials from around the web. I actively started job hunting from April 2015 and have now landed a job at Deloitte Digital!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I wasn't sure I'd get such a good job but I have. I've become more confident with my coding. I've developed more of a stamina to work through problems for longer before my mind gets exhausted. I've started to think about problems in terms of small, bite-sized steps and I've become comfortable with failing and then trying again.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: You know you want to, so stop giving into fear and in the immortal words of Shia Lebeouf "JUST DO IT!".
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It's expensive when you think of it as a cost. Its not so expensive when you think of it as an investment.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was worried that I wouldn't be job ready and that I'd never become better at coding and problem solving but I'm pretty comfortable on both counts now.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Intense, awesome, totally worth it!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Approach an interview like a conversation, not as an interview. Listen to your gut, if you feel something is not right about the company for you, it probably isn't. Do your homework, follow the relevant people from the company on Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and have topics to start a passionate conversation on.

  summary: MSc in Social Policy to Junior Developer at Mergermarket
  testimonial: I now have an interesting job that forces me to think and learn something new everyday and that’s not something I can say for the other jobs I’ve had.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Finishing my MSc in Social Policy at the LSE, trying to work in behavioural sciences and policy research.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I was always interested in building websites and was pretty good at HTML and CSS back in the day. I knew that coding is a valuable skill to have regardless of what industry I end up in.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I think I saw a Facebook or Google ad for Makers Academy at some point &emdash; I don't really remember. I decided to apply after reading some student blogs and testimonials on the website.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The hardest thing for me was being patient with myself. I had high expectations of myself going into the course, and many times when I didn't understand how to complete a task, I had to remember to separate the task at hand from some reflection of myself. It's very easy to fall into a nasty cycle of self-deprecation when you're surrounded by really intelligent, motivated people.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I currently work as a Junior Developer at Mergermarket. After graduation I spent 6 weeks on the floor as an alumni helper while frantically trying to get a job before my visa ran out and landed a job as a rails developer at an ed-tech startup. I've now moved onto to my 2nd job at Mergermarket.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I have an interesting job that forces me to think and learn something new everyday. I can't say that for the other jobs that I've had. I'm surrounded by supportive co-workers on and off the dev team, and it's a really great place to get my software development career started. I also have become very involved with coding-related meetups in London. I currently help organise Codebar each week, and recently became interested in learning Clojure. The London tech community is a tight-knit but welcoming one, and it's a very exciting time for me, personally and professionally.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Many people are put off by coding because they perceive it to be difficult. I was definitely one of these people. However, once you get past the first few weeks of memorising syntax and getting your head around the logic, you will realise that coding is the most incredibly rewarding skill you can learn. From a more pragmatic view, you only need to look at the front page of Techcrunch to see that Software Developers have incredibly high vertical and horizontal mobility -- so if you're the kind of person that doesn't like to sit still, the software development industry will give you freedom to travel and move around. If you get your feet wet with a good boot camp that teaches software craftsmanship and TDD and other best practices, you will have around the equivalent of a 6-month head start on other boot camp graduates applying for the same roles.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It's cheaper than an MSc in Computer Science, you will meet many people who are well-connected, and London development salaries are extremely good compared to continental Europe.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I thought I would be terrible at coding. I'm still not great, but I think I'm no longer terrible.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Admit readily to failure and shortcomings in your knowledge. Don't pretend like you know more than you do. This pisses off team leaders/product managers and instantly flags you as a bad team member. Get a sense of the company culture -- google the CEO, CTO, your immediate supervisor if you can. Have a story for how you discovered the company and why that particular company stands out to you. Assume that all of your social media profiles have been aggregated by recruitment tools and presented to the people interviewing you. Have at least one public repo on your Github that is well-tested, refactored, CLEAN, and that you understand 100%. Preferably not your final project, but better to have something that you built independently after Makers, using at least one new technology not taught on the course. Be sure that you can defend every single method and variable name you've chosen.

  summary: Illustrator to Junior Developer at New Bamboo
  testimonial: Students from Makers Academy are not the same kind of species as normal developers out there and it’s your background and experiences that don’t necessarily relate to coding that will give you an edge.

  categories:

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a Graphic designer and Illustrator.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: The desire to acquire new skills and learn new technologies made me want to start learning to code. I felt limited by my design skills and wanted to open up new doors for myself and expose myself to different opportunities. I also wanted to know how to make things for myself and explore a new creative medium. Coding ticked all the boxes!
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I googled around for courses - Makers was up there as the best. I read countless student reviews and was really impressed by the unique classroom teaching style. I was also won over by the placements team who seemed to be putting graduates into insanely good starting positions at some awesome companies.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: To begin with, I found pairing with other people quite hard and frustrating but then halfway through the course, you learn how to do it well and it's the best experience. I also found the fast pace quite difficult to keep up with. It didn't bother me so much though, and I trusted that given the extra hard work I put it, it would all eventually make sense.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I hit the ground running with back-to-back interviews and technical tests. The placements team are incredible and so supportive. I landed a job 4 weeks later.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: It's turned my life around. I didn't take this course with the intention of becoming a developer. At the time, I was interested in acquiring some front end skills so I could push forward my design work and take things from there. I ended up loving Ruby and getting a full stack role at a brilliant agency. I have a job that I love with clear focus, direction and endless possibilities.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. The direction of your life is never set in stone. Make sensible decisions, follow your heart and enjoy the ride.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I thought the exact same thing. I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to apply for ages because of the huge price tag. But after the first day, you completely forget that this was ever an issue. Worth every penny.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was whether or not I would actually be able to learn anything of any value. Will I understand the content? Will I actually be able to sit down and make something from scratch? Would I become more employable? Will I get a job? Nothing is guaranteed on the course, but I can say that with enough enthusiasm, positivity and hard work there is no reason to worry.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Emotional, exhausting, exhilarating.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be yourself. Students from Makers Academy are not the same kind of species as normal developers out there and it's your background and experiences which don't necessarily relate to coding that will give you an edge. And TDD everything.

    - female
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a recruiter in the IT sector.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I was doing simple websites for friends and family since the age of 14 and wanted to learn how to code to get a job as a Web Developer.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I found the pace of the course difficult as some people in my cohort knew already how to code and they were leading the pace of the lessons.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I finished on 20th June. I took the summer off to travel with my family and clean my GitHub. I started looking for a job on 1st September. I did only one application through LinkedIn and I got the job. I was offered a paid three months internship. After two weeks working there they told me they were very happy with me, so after 6 weeks of internship I was made permanent. I've now moved to my 2nd role at Onfido.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: Makers Academy changed my life. It gave me the confidence that I can achieve whatever I want in life.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: "Do it. It's the best thing you could do to yourself. Confucius said: \"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\" This is so true. I go to work with a smile and when I go back home I feel like I have just been doing something that I like."
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: Living in London for three months without an income can be tough. £8,000 is definitely a lot of money but it's absolutley worth it. It's an investment for your future self.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: I've learned way more than software development. It was tough at the beginning but now I'm seeing the results.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Generally speaking you have more to offer than most employers expect from a Junior grad. Be confident and happy.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Before Makers Academy I did a Masters of Mechanical (Aeronautical) Engineering degree at Durham University.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: The experiences at university, a need for a challenge and wanting to see immediate result of my work led me to learn to code.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy at Silicon Milkroundabout, I had a chat with companies hiring there and they said that Makers Academy was a good start.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I applied to and was hired by Red Badger.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I have a job that I enjoy, that provides me with a challenge every day, surrounded by intelligent people. It's great.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: Make sure you are ready to struggle and are up for the fight.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: How much is a years' worth of university tuition?
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would end up working for a company that I didn't like on a project I didn't care about. I work for a consultancy that cares about everything they do. It's more a culture that is important than that who you are working for at Red Badger.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Make sure you have similar ideals to the company, that you fit their culture. Otherwise you will find it difficult to enjoy it there.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a Research & Development Scientist at Linpac Packaging.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had a little experience from my university degree and really enjoyed it so wanted to pursue it further.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy through a google search. I wanted to apply because it appeared to suit the sort of learning I was looking for. Intensive immersion of learning.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The lack of sleep!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I have moved to London permanently. I achieved my goal of getting a developer role after the course and changing my career. I am now doing something that I enjoy every day and the work/life balance is a lot better.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: For me before I started the course it felt like a huge risk. I was quitting a well paid, secure job and paying a lot of money to do the course. There was no guarantee of employment at the end of it. However it still felt like a calculated risk, and one worth taking. If I didn't take that risk then I would still potentially be working in the same job with very little progress in changing careers. Makers Academy was the fast-track route to changing careers taking a bit more control of my life direction. It is still the best choice I have ever made.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is a lot of money, but you have to question how committed you are to making that change in your life. For me it was worth spending the money because I was committed to making that change.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was the question mark of how long it would take to secure a job after the course - and whether I would be able to secure a developer job or not. Luckily that question has now been answered.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Intense, tiring, fun. Everybody was very positive and driven to learning and working together. It was easy to stay motivated when in that environment.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Try to keep the motivation up after the course and find projects % tasks to code; to and try to pair with people even if it's remotely. I found it very hard to keep motivated sitting in an empty flat during the day. A complete contrast to Makers.

  summary: Business Development Manager to Junior Developer at Red56
  testimonial: Since graduation my life has changed, as I enjoy my work a lot more in general.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  categories:
    - career changer
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a Business Development Manager for a B2B Media Company.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I wanted to have a new skill and I wanted to make things.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: Through an article in Vice that led me to an article in the Guardian. Friends of mine that were Graphic Designers though told me how much demand there was for people with coding experience as well.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Everything! In all seriousness, the hardest thing was the transition from an office mindset to a learning mindset. It took me a while to accept that finding the answers out for myself and moving at that pace was a lot more worth while than getting an answer from somewhere and moving on before I fully understood an issue.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I had intended to go back to my old job for 2 days a week post Makers, while I continued my learning and looking for a job. Makers were able to find me an internship, which has been an excellent way to learn about life as a developer and I got a job at Red56. I feel I have learned a lot more than I would have independently and now I have valuable work experience to add to my CV as well.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I enjoy my work a lot more in general. I have renewed enthusiasm for the two days a week spent at my old job and am loving interning as a developer.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. In my five months since I started at Makers, I have found the tech world inclusive, inspiring, rewarding and fun. It's a great industry to be a part of and it's also growing at a rate of knots. Exciting times!
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: Why would you not want to invest £8,000 in making your life better? You can learn to code in countless ways, however you are unlikely to get a fraction of the benefit you receive from your 12 weeks at Makers. You receive face to face tuition from experienced developers, you meet a group of peers who support you through the course and beyond, you find out about exciting new technologies from real trailblazers, you attend industry events and are able to network with potential employers, you receive talks from developers at all types of businesses (from household e-commerce brands to fledgling starts ups) that tell you of life in the developer world... and you get to do all of this in a first class facility that is open 65 hours a week. If that's not worth £8,000, I don't know what is.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I worried that I would not get "it", however makers taught me that "it" comes to you with hard work and enthusiasm. There is a lot that still baffles me about coding, however I know with patience and the correct approach I can solve any problem.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Awesome!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be yourself, be honest and be enthusiastic. Your first job will likely be a bigger learning curve than Makers. Your potential employer needs to know you are someone who will be keen to learn, is aware of where they need to improve and will be easy to work with.

  summary: Project Manager to iOS Developer at MyGravity
  testimonial: MA was probably the best experience of my life! It was life-changing and like any big change, it wasn’t always easy but I now feel that my future is very bright.
  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  categories:
    - career changer
    - female
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working in project management in a small team at a social enterprise. It was interesting at first, but as time went on I didn't feel like I was developing any tangible skills.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always enjoyed working with computers, but before Makers Academy my limit was really doing fancy graphs in Excel! In 2012 I started doing bits and pieces of Codecademy courses, but without any clear plan or end goal, life (and other hobbies) quickly overtook it. There just didn't seem to be any clear connection between following tutorials, and actually getting a job as a developer.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I read an article about Makers Academy when it first launched (around the time I was graduating from my history degree) and remember filing it away in my head as an awesome idea, but not in my life plan! At the time I needed a job pronto. However, it always stayed in the back of my mind. When in 2014 I started to realise project management wasn't challenging me enough, I kept coming back to the Makers Academy website, but it took me months to work up the courage to apply.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace of the learning is challenging for everyone - if it's wasn't, then Makers wouldn't have been pushing us hard enough. What I found most difficult was suppressing my natural competitiveness. Everyone picks up different things at different paces, and when I felt like I was slower than others around me, it was hard not to beat myself up about it. I learnt to remind myself that the aim was to learn, not to race through the material as fast as possible. Equally if I felt I did understand things that others hadn't yet got, the best thing to do was to help them. It reinforced my understanding, and I knew I could ask them when I needed it. As a cohort, we were stronger together!
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I graduated just before Christmas, so the job market was unusually slow. But I worked at Makers as an alumni helper, which was brilliant, as it forced me to keep reinforcing what I'd learnt on the course. I had a handful of interviews in January, and was offered a job as a Software Developer, after a whirlwind interview process at an exciting personal data start-up.
    - question: Where are you now working?
      answer: I'm working as the lead (and only!) iOS developer at MyGravity. I was originally hired as a Ruby developer, but after a month was asked to take over development of our iPhone and iPad apps. It was daunting at first to be using a language which is so unlike anything we covered at Makers Academy, but I loved the challenge.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: Completely! I'm in a job that keeping me thinking and learning every single day - which is priceless. I'm also working on my own start-up on the side which I would never have even considered before doing Makers Academy. The future is totally unmapped, but feeling very bright right now.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Be as sure as you can before taking the step. If it's coding, try out course like Codecademy. Even if you don't complete it (like me), pay attention to how you feel when you're coding and learning. Is it tiring, or invigorating? Could you picture yourself doing it all day? But also, don't be too afraid of taking that next step - whether that's applying to Makers Academy, or signing up for an online course. If you never give it a shot, how will you ever know?
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive, and you have to be sure you can survive without a salary for four-plus months. Run the numbers, try out living on that budget for a while, because you don't want to be panicking about paying your rent in the middle of the course. However, personally, it was the best decision I've made. It's changed my life and given me a job and prospects that I could have only of dreamt of before. I'd do it again in a shot.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was most worried about how I'd cope with the pace and the pressure - 3 months is a long time to spend cramming your brain with a whole new world of knowledge. Now, I'm proud that I got through it. For me it was really important to look after myself. It might sound small, but making sure I got 7 hours of sleep a night, some exercise everyday cycling into Makers Academy, and a fully stocked freezer of home cooked meals made a massive difference.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Life changing. And like any big change, not easy.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Treat every interview like a learning experience. For every interview that didn't get me a job, it taught me something that I used in my final one. And if it's a tech test - make you have a ready supply of tea on hand!

      answer: Spent a few months freelancing (as needed to sort some other parts of my life out, move house etc). Then told Ruben I was ready to start a full-time job, I got an offer from econsultancy eight days after that.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would stop coding for fun if I was doing it as a career rather than a hobby, and starting finding it boring. That hasn't been a problem - if anything I enjoyed hobby-coding more for being much better at it.

  summary: Psychology Graduate to Junior Developer at usTwo
  testimonial: I received a job offer on the Monday after graduation.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  categories:
    - education leaver
    - female
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a fresh graduate in Psychology considering my career options. I wanted to work in tech but was worried that I was being unrealistic given my background. I was having a hard time finding companies willing to train up a complete beginner, so I was considering doing something non-technical while teaching myself how to code.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've had a strong interest in tech from a young age, although I can't claim to have a history as a hacker. I taught myself enough HTML and CSS to make simple websites, and my experience in university helping societies with their websites made me realise that this was something I really enjoyed doing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across a promoted tweet on Twitter from way back in November 2013. I saved it and emailed it to myself, and I still have that email! It was a giant stroke of luck that I was cleaning up old mail and came across it again roughly 3 weeks before the August cohort started. I had very little time to think about it but looking back it was a no-brainer. With exactly 3 months left on my student visa at that point in time, it would probably be my only opportunity to join Makers Academy.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The intensity of the course was definitely hard at times, especially when you feel like you haven't quite grasped something but the next week and the next new concept are coming your way whether you like it or not! That said, I never felt completely out of my depth, and I knew I could count on my cohort and the coaches to help me out if I needed it.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Graduation was amazing! We'd been working on the project non-stop for two weeks and I know all of my team were really proud of it. It was a great feeling to be able to demo it and see the audience's enthusiasm about something that we made. The week leading up to graduation was tough for me as I was torn between preparing to leave the country and simultaneously juggling job interviews. I'm really happy that it all paid off, and I received a job offer on the Monday after graduation.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: £8,000 for three months of learning is expensive. On the other hand, £8,000 is also the approximate equivalent of the salary you could be earning as a developer in the same time frame of 3 months. I can't deny that it's a big investment, and it's one you have to think through yourself. For me, the resources and learning environment at Makers Academy made it worth it.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was mostly worried that I wouldn't be able to cope with the long hours. At uni, I was used to having a few lectures a week and being left to my own devices the rest of the time. As it turns out, although you are in the building for nine to twelve hours a day, Makers Academy operates on a similar schedule. I found that time flew by when I was engrossed in coding, and it was more of a struggle to get myself to stop thinking about code.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: I learnt a lot about pushing my limits, about working well with others, about what education should be like, and I also learnt how to code along the way.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Bring a laptop and be prepared to show examples of your code on the spot. Separately, I felt a little uneasy about the number of times I said "I don't know" during my technical interview, but in line with the other advice out there, it's better to be upfront about that (and be open to what the interviewer says after that!) than to pretend you know more than you do.

    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: I found after coming out of an intensive boot camp that all you find yourself talking about is code! There are so many jobs out there in this industry so be yourself, don't pretend you're something your not otherwise you won't get the job that is right for you.

  summary: Website Manager to Junior Developer at Deloitte Digital
  testimonial: It was the hardest thing I've ever done and the best thing I've ever done.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  categories:
    - career changer
    - female
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I worked as a Website Manager - writing and editing some blogs and doing bits of SEO and making sure the site gained traffic.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I fell into my past career because I sort of liked writing and I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. But for the past few years I'd been finding it unfulfilling, uninspiring and couldn't see a future in it. I'd worked for tech companies and I felt that if I could start a career as a Developer, I'd have a lot more opportunities open to me, including travel and freelance working.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I started to teach myself how to code, but it was much harder than I thought it would be. A lot of online tutorials either assume too much prior knowledge or just don't apply to real-world situations. I've always thrived in a classroom environment so I decided to search online for face-to-face coding courses and came across Makers Academy. Makers offered a safe environment to learn how to code and could give me the tools I needed to become a Junior Developer.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace was furious! The course covers a great deal of material and, frankly, 12 weeks is not that long! Also, my old job was not very labour intensive so the transition to Makers - working Monday to Friday from 9am till late, and weekends too, was very hard.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I had to go back to my old job as they'd very kindly given me unpaid leave to do the course. However, one day back into the old job reminded me why I hated it so much! I decided to hand in my notice more or less straight away so that I could concentrate on finding a job as a developer. I finished work at the end of December and in mid-January secured an interview with Deloitte Digital through Makers. Two interviews and two hours later I was tentatively offered a job! I started working at Deloitte in February and I am very happy there.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I actually look forward to going to work! I feel proud of all the hard work I've put in to become a Junior Developer and very positive about my future career.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. It's a scary and tough decision, but if you're unhappy in your current position, if you're feeling trapped, frustrated and you're wasting your life then you should absolutely change your career if you have the means to.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I would say you're right, it's a lot of money, but I think the expense made me really value the course. It made me work really hard, and I'm glad I did because it has totally paid off. I'm now working for a brilliant digital company, earning more than I was before - it won't take long to earn the course fee back.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was worried that I would struggle and that I'd find the course too difficult. And it was difficult and I did struggle but I had a great deal of support from the coaches and the staff so that the workload never became too much to handle. Another great source of help and support throughout the course were the members of my cohort. Makers created a real camaraderie, we all bonded over the experience and learned from each other, and we're still good friends now.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It was the hardest thing I've ever done and the best thing I've ever done.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be enthusiastic and show your passion for coding. Most hirers aren't expecting top-grade developers after 12 weeks of learning to code, but they will want to see that you've learned a lot, you're willing to learn more and you'll be a great addition to their team. Although, having attended Makers, you will already be all of those things!

      answer: Everything. It's really hard to keep up with the course but at the same time I had a wonderful time, I've met incredible people and I would do it again and again.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I kept coding everyday. I went over all my projects on Github and studied technologies that we didn't touch during the course. I did a few technical tests and at the beginning of March I got an offer for a front-end role at Legal and General.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I've got a great job so I'm really happy and I moved to Brighton which is beautiful. A great change from being a Waitress to becoming a Developer in less than a year.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it! Don't think twice.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive but you need to invest in yourself to achieve what you really want.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was I would not be good enough to learn to code in 12 week and that I will not find a job after the course. I however did it even if it was hard, it wasn't impossible. I found a great job so I'm very happy and i feel accomplished.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Challenging and frustrating, spending 11-12 hours per day coding, but at the same time a great experience. I had a lot of fun and met incredible people. It's something that will stay with me forever.

    - career changer
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as an editor for the local newspaper "Oberhessische Presse" in Marburg, Germany.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: By working on small blog projects I got obsessed by coding problems but I also knew that I wasn't actually coding but fiddling around and from my work experience I knew that I could land a way more interesting job if I knew how to code. I had unsuccessfully applied for two of those.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I think I had read about Steer.me and started Googleing for it when I had decided to learn how to code. Makers Academy ranked better and offered something way more substantial.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The beginning was hard. I thought I was just too stupid to get encapsulation and proper OOP done.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I came back to the guy at Zeit.de who had told me a year ago that they had decided to give the job to another applicant who knew how to code. I told them what I had learned and asked him if I could work with them on a small project. The next morning he called and offered me a paid internship in research & development.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I came from a depressed industry (journalism) where graduates can't find jobs and experienced editors lose them for financial reasons. Now I have a leg up in a fast growing industry and skills even news organisations are looking for. That feels great.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you plan to leave your old career and become a full time Developer, prepare for a long and demanding but rewarding trip. If you see a way this ias a way to boost your old career with coding skills it's going to be much easier.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is. If you are disciplined enough to take five months off and learn how to code with online tutorials you can save money. However, the advantage of Makers Academy is that you learn best practices like TDD from the very beginning and that you are pulled forward when you feel like staying at one topic to grasp it entirely. Which made me learn much more in three month than I would have learned on my own.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would really learn how to code but I did! I am not an experienced engineer but I can understand what they are doing and I can build a whole lot of things myself.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Three of the most empowering months of my life.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a Marketing Executive at an ICT training company.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I loved tech and I was fascinated by coding, and wanted to work in the tech industry.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: Makers Academy was a competitor to a programme that my previous company offered. Needless to say, I preferred the Makers approach.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Almost nothing was easy but I did cope a lot better than I thought I would from a sanity perspective.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was job hunting for a few weeks but the first place at which I interviewed offered me the job and I've already started.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I'm getting paid to do the same things I did at Makers Academy and I love it.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Just do it, life's too short to put up with a job that you don't enjoy.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It's all relative. £8000 is a lot for three months, but it's a drop in the ocean compared to what you'll end up being able to earn throughout your career.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was pretty sure I'd find a job eventually but I was so worried I wouldn't find one quickly enough before my savings ran out. If I'd have known I'd be so lucky and walk straight into a job I would never have worried.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: A rollercoaster ride that can make you feel empowered and then inadequate from one day to the next - but the end goal is totally worth it.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as an Investment analyst.
    - question: What did you learn to code?
      answer: To be able to build my MVP for my startup and understand how things work.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: A friend of mine recommended Makers Academy among other names. I liked the programme, and the dates suited me.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Being tired all the time.
    - question: What did you choose to learn to code rather than find a technical co-founder?
      answer: Since my website is the main product of my startup, it's important to me to understand how it's built and how it works. I don't want to have to rely entirely on someone else for the tech part of the business. I will eventually partner with a tech co-founder in the long-run, I think it's essential to have some tech knowledge in order to be able to communicate and work efficiently with my CTO/tech team.

      answer: Without Makers Academy, I don't think I would have been able to build a website myself. Through Makers, I also met awesome people who helped me build the site and gave me great advice and ideas.
    - question: Are you still coding/involved in the technical side of your business?
      answer: I am finishing up building my MVP at the moment, so yes!
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: If you are interested in coding and have sufficient time, money and drive to do it, you should definitely do it. But to make the most of the experience, you should be ready to put in a lot of time and effort. It would be a plus for entrepreneurs to have an idea of the technologies they would use, so that they can focus their learning on these languages. Another advantage of Makers is access to the tech industry and a growing network of alumni.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as the Digital Brand Director at Syco Entertainment/Sony Music.
    - question: Why did you learn to code?
      answer: I learned to code so I could build prototypes, manage developers and understand the world we live in.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy on Google. The phrase "Oxford vs the Marines but for coders" is what sold it to me. I think you have to be somewhat unhinged to pay a lot of money for three months of torture - so that sentence did a good job of filtering out the sane people and only attracting the loons.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Confidence. Generally I'm fairly good at picking up new skills, but coding I really struggled with. Feeling stupid has to be one of the biggest confidence killers.
    - question: Why did you choose to learn to code rather than go and find a technical co-founder?
      answer: An old mentor of mine always told me how important it is as CEO to understand everything about your business. You can't just hire an accountant and not take the time to understand the company accounts yourself, so why would you not take the time to understand your own product which is the foundation of your entire business?
    - question: Tell us more about your business?
      answer: We build software that helps brands collaborate with highly influential YouTubers. You can see more at <a href='http://peg.co' target='_blank'>peg.co</a>.
    - question: How do you think Makers Academy helped in setting up your tech business?
      answer: It gave me the knowledge I needed to build our MVP and I found my two cofounders there.
    - question: Have you raised? If so, how much and from where?
      answer: Yes - we're closing right now. It's in the region of £325k at a post-valuation of about £2.6m. All angel investors.
    - question: Are you still coding/involved in the technical side of your business?
      answer: A bit. I still build prototypes for new features/product ideas but generally don't touch much production code.
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: Do it. I believe that understanding how to code is as important now (if not more so) than learning Maths and Science at school. Tech entirely surrounds us in the world we live in. Why would you not want to have an understanding of that? And if you're planning on building a tech company it's an absolute no-brainer.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I worked on Wall St and in the City for Deutsche Bank and UBS.
    - question: Why did you learn to code?
      answer: I learnt to code because I wanted to build my own MVPs but I learnt so much more than that. It got me hosting on Airbnb and I learnt a lot from the Founders about the Lean Startup. Most of all though, it allowed me to understand what coders are saying!
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I came across Makers while exploring an escape from finance and thought it was for me, very quickly! I met with the team and then I was certain.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Nothing. It was easy! - The truth? Almost everything, the nature of coding is that you have to understand lots of concepts all at once. It is hard to keep track!
    - question: Why did you choose to learn to code rather than go and find a technical co-founder??

    - question: How do you think Makers Academy helped in setting up your tech business?
      answer: Apart from meeting an amazing developer, it taught me how to talk "code". I know what an API is, I can imagine how software might do the things the business needs. It was invaluable!
    - question: Have you raised? If so, how much and from where?
      answer: Yes we have raised money from Pi Labs and we are invested in by James Caan, who invests in Pi Labs.

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Until July 2014, I was MD of a translation agency which I tried to acquire. The deal eventually fell through after 12 months and I left the business to ponder about what I should do with my career from there. Having fallen out of love with the industry, I knew that I would have to do something radically different that would retain my interest.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've had an obsession with technology from a very young age. I loved computer games and later computers. My mum and step dad had both worked in software sales at one point or another which is how I started to see tech as a fun way to make money. During my time in the translation industry, I sold and implemented technologies for enterprise but none of the products that was on the market really turned me on. I wanted to gain the power to build my own stuff. Being able to code gives you the tools to turn your ideas in to a tangible thing that people can interact with. How cool is that?
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?
      answer: I had previously met Evgeny at a couple of London startup events and he told me about Makers. I won't lie, I was sceptical as Maths and Physics were probably my weakest subjects at school. I also could not see a way to take three months out of my career to make it happen so I parked the idea. Since I was 'taking a break' from August 2014, I decided it was now or never and so I finally bit the bullet and sent in my application.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Everything! To some extent, my suspicions about my natural ability to code were confirmed when I struggled with some of the core concepts. I am extremely impatient and coding, especially debugging requires a huge amount of patience. Initially, I also found myself competing against my peers as I have a very competitive nature. It felt very unsettling to suddenly be in an environment where I was not top of the class. Although it got easier with time, I would say that I was deeply humbled by the whole experience.
    - question: What happened during / after graduation?
      answer:  I decided not to take a break and threw myself in to my new project. I am currently working on scoping my MVP (Minimum Valuable Product) I also worked out a lot to shift the extra stone I gained during the course. It seems that coding can make you fat! I then however got accepeted onto <a href='http://www.joinef.com/' target='_blank'>entrepreneur first</a> as one of only 3 women on the cohort of 34 and they had more than 5000 applicants.
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: Definitely do it if you plan to start a tech business! You should learn to code because you can't sail a ship unless you know how that ship works. It also does not hurt to develop empathy with your team and the process for developing amazing products. Learning what bullshit smells like removes a layer of doubt and vulnerability for a founder who is hiring. That said, I believe very strongly in the importance of a founding team. I am now able to build a MVP to show to potential co-founders which makes my venture a more attractive proposition.
    - question: How has learning to code help you become a better entrepreneur?
      answer:  I am better equipped to make some initial technology decisions myself and am empowered to start building something without depending on others. The thought of outsourcing to a dev shop or freelancer always filled me with dread because I would have had no idea what bad looks like.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8000 is very expensive?
      answer: Depends how you look at it. For most people (including myself), 8k is a lot of money. The cost is actually much higher than that if you take in to account living expenses, loss of earnings etc. In my opinion, I think that the course is excellent value for the money you pay. That does not make it inexpensive but it means that you definitely get what you pay for. If anyone is unsure, they just need to look at the quality of the <a href='http://www.makersacademy.com/graduates' target='_blank'>final projects.</a>.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience?
      answer: The twelve most intense, insanely challenging and rewarding weeks of my life!
